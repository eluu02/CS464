# SP24-Physical-Keyboard-Layout-Test
## Checkpoint 1
### Member contributions
Ethan Luu — Built the app foundation and added functionality. Worked on methodology and related work in the checkpoint one report.

Casey Stumpf — Added functionality to the app, formatted and styled the application, created and uploaded video, and worked on the introduction and related work in the checkpoint one report.

The future work distribution will be split evenly. We will finish the code report together and conduct experiments as a pair.  The project will only be done with more than one pair of eyes checking accuracy.
### Meetings
This group holds two- to three-hour meetings three times a week on various days, depending on schedule. We plan to uphold this schedule for the rest of the project.  In the meetings, we utilize code with me, Google Docs, overleaf, and Discord to stay organized and code with each other.  This helps us achieve our goal of having more than one pair of eyes on every piece of work done.
